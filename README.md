## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

``
/movies

``

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Movie App

This project is a simple yet functional web application that allows users to browse, search, and view details of movies. The application fetches data from the OMDB API and includes features for searching movies, viewing detailed information about a selected movie, handling loading states and errors gracefully, and managing favorite movies.

## Features

- **Home Page**: Displays a list of movies fetched from the API with a search bar to search for movies by title.
- **Details Page**: Displays detailed information about the selected movie, including title, year, genre, director, plot, and poster.
- **Favorites**: Allows users to save their favorite movies locally.
- **Pagination**: Supports pagination for the movie list on the home page.
- **Responsive Design**: Uses Chakra UI for a clean and intuitive user interface.
- **Navigation**: Provides a navigation bar for easy access to different sections of the application.
